# urchin-annotations
A collection of high resolution benthic imagery and associated annotations for urchin species in Hawaii.

# Organization
This repo has several folders organized by site name. Each folder contains segmented images from the full site mosaic (1000x1000) and a matching .xml file for each image with label and bounding box information.

## Annotation information
For the purposes of the machine learning project these images were used for, "empty" .xml files were created for image segments that did not contain urchins.
